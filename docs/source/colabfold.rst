Running ColabFold
=================

Some instructions for running `ColabFold`_ on epyc. I presented some of these instructions and a general overview of AlphaFold2 and ColabFold during an SBDR seminar (`slides`_).

These are basic instructions for connecting to epyc and running a ColabFold job from the command line. It is also possible to use Microsoft's `VSCode`_ to connect if you are wanting a better experience.

Using Microsoft Visual Studio Code
----------------------------------

The benefit of using `VSCode`_ is that you have a nice environment for editing files (rather than using `vim` in a terminal).

Download and install `VSCode`_ for your operating system
